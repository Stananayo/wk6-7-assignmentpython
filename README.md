# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## Description
This repository demonstrates how to load, analyze, and visualize a dataset using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Objective:
- To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python.
- To create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

## Submission Requirements:
- A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py) file is required. The file should contain:
  - Data loading and exploration steps (e.g., checking data types, handling missing values).
  - Basic data analysis results (e.g., descriptive statistics, correlations).
  - Visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, bar charts).
  - Findings and observations based on the analysis and visualizations.

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

1.  Choose a dataset: Select a CSV dataset.  For example, you can use the Iris dataset, a sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice.  Crucially, replace `your_dataset.csv` with the actual name of your CSV file in the code!

2.  Download the dataset: Download the chosen dataset and place it in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

3.  Load the dataset using pandas: Import the pandas library and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

4.  Explore the data: Display the first few rows, data types of each column, and summary statistics (using `df.head()`, `df.dtypes`, `df.describe()`).  Look for potential issues like missing values, unusual data types, or outliers.

**Example Code Snippet (to be included in your notebook/script):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual file name
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
    print("Dataset loaded successfully!")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File 'your_dataset.csv' not found. Please check the file path.")
    exit()

# Example of basic exploration
print("First 5 rows:\n", df.head())
print("\nData types:\n", df.dtypes)
print("\nSummary statistics:\n", df.describe())

# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## Description

This repository demonstrates how to load, analyze, and visualize a dataset using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Objective

- To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python.
- To create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

## Submission Requirements

- A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py) file is required. The file should contain:
  - Data loading and exploration steps (e.g., checking data types, handling missing values).
  - Basic data analysis results (e.g., descriptive statistics, correlation analysis).
  - Visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots).
  - Any findings or observations.

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

1. Choose a dataset in CSV format (for example, you can use datasets like the Iris dataset, a sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
2. Load the dataset using pandas.
3. Explore the dataset to understand its structure, including:
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Checking for and handling missing values.
   - Understanding the data types of each column.
   - Generating descriptive statistics for the dataset.

## Task 2: Data Analysis

1. Perform basic analyses on the dataset:
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).
   - Identify relationships between different features in the dataset using correlation coefficients.
  
## Task 3: Data Visualization

1. Use matplotlib to create visualizations of your analysis:
   - Create plots such as histograms, scatter plots, or box plots to visualize the distribution of values.
   - Generate line charts or bar charts to illustrate trends or comparisons between different categories.

## Findings and Observations

- Summarize any insightful findings or interesting patterns discovered during your analysis.
- Note any limitations or challenges faced during the analysis process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- matplotlib library
# Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual file name
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
    print("Dataset loaded successfully!")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File 'your_dataset.csv' not found. Please check the file path.")
    exit()

# Example of basic exploration
print("First 5 rows:\n", df.head())
print("\nData types:\n", df.dtypes)
print("\nSummary statistics:\n", df.describe())

## Explanation and Improvements:
 Error Handling: The code now includes a try-except block to gracefully handle cases where the CSV file is not found, preventing the script from crashing.  This is crucial in real-world applications.

Missing Value Handling (Crucial): The code now checks for missing values (isnull().sum()).  Critically, it includes a placeholder comment about how to handle them.  Missing values are a very common problem, and ignoring them can lead to misleading or incorrect results.  You need to decide how to address missing data (e.g., dropping rows with missing values, filling them with a mean/median/mode, or using more sophisticated imputation techniques).  The commented-out example shows how to drop rows with missing data; replace this with the appropriate strategy for your data.

    More Information: The code now shows the data types of each column, summary statistics (using describe()), and the unique values and counts for a specific column (e.g., 'species').  This gives you a broader view of the dataset.

Next Steps (for a complete analysis):

    Choose your specific analysis tasks: What do you want to learn from this dataset? (e.g., is there a relationship between petal width and species? Are there differences in the sepal length between species?)
    Visualizations: Create plots to visualize the data you've explored. Examples:
        Histograms: To see the distribution of individual features (sepal length, petal width, etc.).
        Box Plots or Violin Plots: To compare the distributions of features across different species.
        Scatter Plots: To visualize the relationship between two features.
        Pair Plots (Seaborn): To visualize all pairwise relationships between features.
        Bar charts for counts: To visualize species counts.
    Data Analysis: Perform any necessary calculations (e.g., means, standard deviations, correlations) to uncover insights.
    Findings and Observations: Document your interpretations and any interesting patterns or trends you discover.

## Example of Adding a Visualization (Scatter Plot):

# # Example Scatter Plot (sepal length vs. petal length for each species)
sns.scatterplot(x='sepal_length', y='petal_length', hue='species', data=df)
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Petal Length")
plt.title("Sepal Length vs. Petal Length by Species")
plt.show()

### PANDAS 

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Replace 'your_data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file
filepath = 'iris.csv'  # Example using the Iris dataset

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    print("Dataset loaded successfully!")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found. Please check the file path.")
    exit()

# Display some initial information about the dataset
print("\nFirst 5 rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

print("\nData types of each column:")
print(df.dtypes)

print("\nSummary statistics:")
print(df.describe())

# Further exploration:  Checking for missing values (important!)
print("\nMissing values:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Example of handling missing values (if any).  Crucial step!
#  Replace this with the appropriate method for your data.
# if df.isnull().values.any():  
#   df = df.dropna() # Drop rows with missing values.
#   print("Rows with missing values removed.")
# else:
#   print("No missing values found.")

# Example of examining the unique values of a specific column (species)
print("\nUnique species in the dataset:", df['species'].unique())

# Example of counting the occurrences of each species
species_counts = df['species'].value_counts()
print("\nSpecies Counts:")
print(species_counts)
